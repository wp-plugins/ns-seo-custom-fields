Include content from custom fields in the Yoast WordPress SEO plugin's keyword analysis (WordPress SEO by Yoast is required).

== Description ==

Ever wanted to have your custom fields evaluated as part of the post's content in the Yoast WordPress SEO plugin's keyword statistics? With NS Custom Fields for Wordpress SEO, now you can!

For architecturally-advanced sites that use ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) or another post meta framework to store different parts of a post's content, WordPress SEO's usually-helpful keyword statistics can become skewed since they don't take keywords in all that custom field content into account.

With this plugin, you can specify up to 3 custom fields that you'd like to count as "content" (works for normal posts, pages AND custom post types!) when keyword scoring takes place. Say hello to accurate keyword statistics again.

If you want even more functionality, like support for ACF Repeater and Flexible Content fields, including custom fields in Yoast's automatic meta descriptions, or specifiying unlimited custom fields, [check out our Pro version!](http://neversettle.it/ns-automation)
